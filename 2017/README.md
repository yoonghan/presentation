# Bitcoin and Blockchain
Bitcoin was already gaining traction in the past few years, and alot of colleagues was already discussing 'bout it. The only problem was, nobody actually know what it is, besides the name and price.

This presentation was to introduce Bitcoin and briefly explain what it is.
The second presentation slide is to explain the technology behind Blockchain. It does not cover in depth, but interestly many of the colleagues had a good grasp of what the technology is.

Overall a good presentation with many nice feedbacks.
